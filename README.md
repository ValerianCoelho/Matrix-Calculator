# Matrix Calculator
This is a Python program that solves matrices using the Elementary Transformation method. The program can handle both single and double matrices (augmented matrices).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10.2 or above
- fractions module (included in Python's standard library)

## Running the program
To run the program, simply execute the file MatrixSolver.py or Download the .exe file From the "Release" Section.

## Usage
### Single Matrix
If you want to solve a single matrix, the program will prompt you to enter the number of rows and columns of the matrix. After that, you will be prompted to enter each element of the matrix. The program will then display the matrix in echelon form.

### Double Matrix (Augmented Matrix)
If you want to solve a double matrix (augmented matrix), the program will prompt you to enter the number of rows and columns for both the first and second matrices. You will then be prompted to enter each element of both matrices. The program will then display the double matrix in echelon form.

## Additional Features
If a zero is encountered on the diagonal of the matrix, the program will ask if you want to swap rows. If you choose to swap rows, the program will perform the swap and display the swapped matrix.
The program uses a custom MatrixDisplayer module that prints matrices in a more visually appealing way.
